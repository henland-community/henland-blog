_Overview of all the twitter spaces around the Teia Project on the community update Days (February 22nd and 23rd 2022)_


A lot has happened over the last few weeks and following everything in discord can be really hard. We plan to host several community update twitter spaces in multiple languages at different times on February 22nd and 23nd.    

Additionally, there will be an interview with several teia contributors for the tezos art magazine [“The Tickle”](https://twitter.com/InWarhol).  

## Schedule
These are the currently confirmed spaces, we plan on adding more spaces in different languages (i.e. Portuguese and Indonesian) - check our [official teia community account](https://twitter.com/TeiaCommunity) for the most up to date info!
