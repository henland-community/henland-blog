Released by the Teia Community on February 2nd, 2022

_Drafted by: Turbulent Determinism, Qizzio, MerchantCoppola, esduhh_

We are pleased to announce that the final round of voting has concluded for the name of the community version of Hic et Nunc. The name that has been decided by the community is:

## Teia

It was a close call and 'SYNQ' was a strong contender. Voting has been carried out on the Tezos blockchain using [the H=N Community Vote Tool](https://vote.teia.art/) (round 1: 2259 votes, round 2: 1285 votes). We are grateful to all who have helped us get to this point, and we appreciate all the enthusiasm and creative energy the naming process has sparked within the community. This marks the first milestone for our new platform, but we are just getting started. If you would like to be a part of this project, please see Note (2) at the end about volunteering.

Along with this result, we are pleased to announce that we are changing the name of our group from "The HEN Community" to "The Teia Community". We hope that this will allow for increased clarity about who we are and how this project relates to the original Hic et Nunc.

A group of extremely committed volunteers have been working hard for the past few months to keep this project alive. This group will continue to oversee the project while a full DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is formed. Further details will be announced in the coming weeks/months.

The process for choosing a new logo has not yet been finalized, but in the meantime, you can view some concepts on [this figma page](https://melm.notion.site/TEIA-Logo-Proposals-7dab67576b2b481fb7ec3cb99e80cebd) and [submit your own logo ideas in this google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe27ZughzLlh44BQXjrXto4b9qRTAB9SX-d-YMTCUPYdD6lRg/viewform?usp=sf_link) or [in the naming channel of the Discord group](https://discord.com/channels/908672304236625970/909355171455336489). If you share a logo that is an adaptation of someone else's concept, please credit the original creator.

Teia.art currently uses the HEN v2 contract for swaps, but will switch to the Teia Community marketplace in the next week or two, once testing is complete. You can read some of the details on the new marketplace contract [here](https://blog.teia.art/blog/introducing-henc-smart-contracts), and you can view the contract itself [here](https://github.com/teia-community/objkt-swap/blob/3.0.0/smart-py/marketplace.py). An independent audit of the contract was completed by inference.ag, and you can find more details about this in the blog post (linked above).

In addition to the new marketplace contract, we have created [a new multisig wallet](https://github.com/jagracar/tezos-smart-contracts/blob/1.0.0/python/contracts/multisignWalletContract.py). This multisig wallet will make it possible for the community to collect platform fees on swaps done on the Teia platform. A team of around 15 people have been given custody of this wallet while we are working on building democratic structures for governing the organization Teia DAO. Please note that this team is in place only to sign transactions that the community decides on, not to form decisions.

The new marketplace website is [teia.art](https://teia.art). We have done our best to maintain cross compatibility with the other versions of Hic et Nunc. Our developers are working with Manitcor (who has been maintaining the hicetnunc.art website - [read some background here](https://discourse.teia.art/t/hi-im-joe-founder-of-integro-labs-and-teztools-i-will-be-your-custodian-for-this-journey/300)) to make sure that existing links are not broken and maintain cross compatibility wherever possible.

Minting OBJKTs on Teia will take place with the same smart minting contract ([github.com/hicetnunc2000/objkt-swap](https://github.com/hicetnunc2000/objkt-swap)) that hicetnunc.xyz (and hicetnunc.art) use for their minting function. You will be able to swap your tokens on any platform/mirror that supports OBJKT token trading (like [hicetnunc.xyz](https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/), [hic.af](https://hic.af/), [hen.teztools.io](https://hen.teztools.io/), [henext.xyz](https://www.henext.xyz/) and many more). We are working with [Objkt.com](https://objkt.com/) and [Versum](https://versum.xyz/) to ensure that swaps done on the Teia Community marketplace contract show up properly on these platforms in the future.

We would like to express our appreciation to all community members who have helped us get to this point. It has been a difficult time for our community, and we are grateful for your patience, understanding, and assistance. Running a truly decentralized, non-hierarchical organization presents significant challenges of organization, communication, and governance. We know that we will not always get things right the first time, or be able to move as fast as a 'traditional' organization; however, we are hopeful that the benefits of an open-source, community-driven 'web3' platform will outweigh these challenges. We have a chance here to build something really special: a global, decentralized, transparent platform owned and run by the community, where all are welcome and any who wish to contribute can do so.

You can set your level of involvement and time commitment. Even if you are not able to volunteer, you are welcome to suggest ideas and offer feedback through twitter, our discord, or our forum.

**Hic et Nunc** is an open-source, experimental NFT marketplace on the Tezos blockchain, initiated by Rafael Lima (BR) and launched on March 1st, 2021. It has seen tremendous success and global participation, however the frontend ([hicetnunc.xyz](https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/)) was unexpectedly shut down by its founder on November 11, 2021. Due to open source and blockchain enabled Web3 capability, many 'clones' kept the experience and marketplace active. The original front end domain was put back online on January 25th, 2022 , but its future direction remains unclear.

**Teia** ([teia.art](https://teia.art/)) is a community effort by a worldwide group of former Hic et Nunc users & contributors to evolve the former Hic et Nunc project into a community owned and controlled NFT marketplace. We invite everybody to participate and we want to create an inclusive environment for those of all backgrounds and identities. Please see [our Code of Conduct](https://www.notion.so/hen-community/Code-of-Conduct-Terms-Conditions-Core-Values-b79fc969a66246f18706be742d2e7baf) for further details.

Our mission to reach true decentralization and equity includes something that no other marketplace has: a community-decided allotment to guarantee marginalized communities are included in governance. We understand that now is the time to take a novel, genuine approach to equitable governance and acknowledging the needs of our most underrepresented communities in a concrete way. Leaders within these groups are being nominated by the community and will be included in the weaving of the new Teia DAO.
