In support for our Ukrainian friends, brothers and sisters, [Veqtor](https://twitter.com/Veqtor) from Versum in conjunction with FxHash set up a shared [donation contract](https://tzkt.io/KT1DWnLiUkNtAQDErXxudFEH63JC6mqg3HEx/operations) that will redirect tezos to multiple charity orgs (listed below) in support of Ukraine relief, 

The Teia Community wants to help support this initiative alongside [Versum](https://versum.xyz/), [FxHash](https://www.fxhash.xyz/) and objkt.com, who all joined in donating to that contract.

The organisations chosen are all non-militarian (medical, aid, journalism, etc.) and the list can be changed if certain organisations are found to be problematic later on.

Everyone can help by supporting Ukrainian artists, donating tezos, raising money via NFTsales, collect or share fundraiser art and spread the word about this initiative!


[NFTBiker](https://twitter.com/NFTBiker) set up an overview Page for the Event, where you can see the amount of money raised, the money already sent out to the orgs and the OBJKT that are minted with the collab contract so that profits & royalties are redirected to the donation smart contract:

He also built a page that lists OBJKTs by Ukranian Artists:
